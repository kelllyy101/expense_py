## User Experience Design (UX)
The Expense Tracker project aims to provide users with a straightforward and efficient way to manage their expenses and monitor their budget. The user experience is designed to be intuitive, with clear prompts and informative displays that guide users through the process of entering expenses and analyzing their spending habits. 

The project's codebase encapsulates these UX principles, offering a seamless experience for users to manage their finances effectively. The utilization of emojis, color-coded messages, and clear menus contributes to a user-friendly interface that encourages users to make informed financial decisions.

### The Strategy Plane
The project's UX strategy revolves around simplicity, clarity, and functionality:

Expense Input: Users can easily input their expenses by providing a name, amount, and selecting a category from a predefined list. This minimizes user effort while ensuring that all necessary information is captured.

Budget Awareness: The application promotes budget awareness by displaying the remaining budget for the month and the daily budget for the remaining days. These figures are presented in a way that users can quickly assess their spending status.

Category Summaries: Users can view summarized expenses by category, allowing them to identify areas where they are spending the most. The amounts are presented clearly, aiding quick comprehension.

Budget Feedback: Users receive immediate feedback based on their budget adherence. If they are staying within budget, a positive message is displayed in green. If they exceed their budget, a warning message is shown in red, emphasizing the need for adjustment.

Menu Navigation: The application employs a menu-driven approach for easy navigation. Users are presented with options to add expenses, view expense summaries, adjust their budget, or exit the tracker.

The project's codebase encapsulates these UX principles, offering a seamless experience for users to manage their finances effectively. The utilization of emojis, color-coded messages, and clear menus contributes to a user-friendly interface that encourages users to make informed financial decisions.

#### Site Goals
Site Goals:

## Testing

### Test Strategy
1. Code Structure and Style Testing (PEP8):
I ran my code through a PEP8 linter to ensure it adhered to Python's style guidelines.
I corrected any formatting issues or violations reported by the linter.

2. Functionality Testing with Print Statements:
I inserted print statements at key points in my code to confirm the execution flow.
For example, I added print statements at the beginning of each function to ensure they were being called.
I ran the app and verified that the print statements showed up at the expected points.

3.User Testing (Creator as User):
I pretended I was a user and went through various scenarios to test the app's functionality.
I added expenses, viewed expenses by category, adjusted the budget, and exited the app.
I tested with both valid and invalid inputs to ensure the app handled them gracefully.

4. End-to-End Testing:
I created test cases that simulated the entire user journey from start to finish.
This included scenarios like adding expenses, viewing expenses, and adjusting the budget in one go.
I also inputted symbols, letters and numbers to test user input validation, ensuring that it will be handled appropriately, for example, an error message when a symbol is entered for an amount float value.

E.g Enter expense amount: ///
    Please enter valid numbers for the expense amount.
    Enter expense amount: 

5. Budget Adjustment Testing:
I tested the budget adjustment functionality.
I checked that the budget was updated correctly and that I received appropriate feedback.

E.g Enter the new budget: 23232
    Budget adjusted to: 23232.00 üí∞üìä

6. Error Handling Testing:
I intentionally input incorrect data (e.g., non-numeric values) to test the app's error handling.
I verified that the app displayed meaningful error messages and handled the errors gracefully.

E.g Invalid choice. Please choose a valid option (1/2/3/4)

7. Integration Testing:
I tested the interactions between different functions and components of the app.
I verified that data flowed correctly and the app behaved as expected.

8.Visual Testing (Lighthouse or Similar Tools):
I used tools like Lighthouse to evaluate web accessibility, performance, and best practices since I planned to deploy the app on a web platform.
I addressed any issues identified by the tool to enhance the app's overall quality.

9. User Experience Testing:
I ensured that the app's prompts and messages were clear and user-friendly.
I tested the navigation flow to ensure users could easily move between different features.

10. Manual Testing of Different Scenarios:
I tested various combinations of actions to identify any potential conflicts or unexpected behavior.
For example, I added expenses, adjusted the budget, viewed expenses, and exited the app in different orders.

11. Boundary Testing:
I tested the app with extreme inputs, such as very large or very small values for expenses and budget.
I verified that the app handled these inputs without crashing or producing incorrect results.

E.g You've spent üí≤234234342343243904.00 this month!

12. Cross-Platform Testing:
I tested the app on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure compatibility.
I verified that the app ran and behaved consistently on all platforms.

13. Documentation Review:
I reviewed my README and other documentation to ensure they accurately reflected the app's features and usage instructions.

I've ensured that my code is error-free and all validation checks have been implemented, meeting the requirements for documenting logic planning, addressing validation errors, and performing manual code testing.

## Deployment
Heroku is a platform that allows you to deploy and host your applications, which is what I used for this expense tracker and these are the following steps I took:

1. I signed up for a Heroku account at https://www.heroku.com/.

2. I installed the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) on your system. This CLI tool lets you manage and deploy your Heroku apps from the command line.

3. I ensured your project is in a Git repository. 

4. A requirements.txt file and a Procfile was added from Code Institute's template so the project would deploy successfully.

5. I created a new Heroku app using the Heroku CLI after I logged into my account and made sure my Git repository was connected.

7. Before creating the app, I added two buildpacks from the Settings tab making sure to add heroku/python first, followed by heroku/nodejs.

8. I deployed my project to Heroku by pushing your Git repository to Heroku's remote, that will update with every git push, as chosen by me in the settings, successfully integrating and deploying my project for use through the Heroku URL.


### Project Creation

The Expense Tracker is a CLI-based budget management application written in Python. It allows users to track their expenses, categorize them, and monitor their budget for the month. Users can input the amount spent, the expense category, and a name for the expense, and the application will calculate the remaining budget for the month and the daily budget for the rest of the month.
